## 📥 Opening an Issue
Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

## 🪲 Bug Reports and Other Issues
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. ✌️

In short, since you are most likely a developer, provide a ticket that you would like to receive.

## 💌 Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We want to avoid feature creep. Your idea may be great, but also out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!
- Do not open a duplicate feature request. Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.

## 🔁 Submitting Pull Requests
We love pull requests! Before forking the repo and creating a pull request for non-trivial changes, it is usually best to first open an issue to discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the comments for an existing issue.

For most contributions, after your first pull request is accepted and merged, you will be invited to the project and given push access. 🎉

Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license (*MIT*).

## 💅 Coding Style
Consistency is the most important. Following the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you are modifying and of the overall project. Failure to do so will result in a prolonged review process that has to focus on updating the superficial aspects of your code, rather than improving its functionality and performance.
